# Toronto AI Learning Group Repository
Welcome to the official repository for the Toronto AI Learning Group - a collaborative space where community-led sessions, resources, and discussions are organized and shared.

# 📚 Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized archive for all materials presented or referenced during our learning sessions. By consolidating content in one place, we aim to foster accessibility, continuity, and shared growth across our community of learners and educators.

# 📁 Repository Structure
All files are curated and organized into folders based on session themes, dates, or content types. These may include:
- 📄 PDF handouts and presentation slides
- 🎥 Video recordings and external links
- 📝 Supplementary notes and reading materials
- 💻 Code samples and interactive notebooks

Please note that the directory structure is subject to change as the repository evolves to accommodate new formats, topics, and organizational needs.

# 📌 Contribution & Updates
Sessions are added on a rolling basis by contributors and facilitators. If you would like to contribute materials or suggest improvements to the structure, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# 🤝 Community Ethos
This repository reflects the collaborative spirit of our learning group. We encourage respectful dialogue, curiosity-driven exploration, and inclusive participation.

# Happy Learning! 😊
