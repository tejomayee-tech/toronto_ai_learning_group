# Budget Option A — Balanced Budget (recommended for stability)


### Parts (exact/typical SKUs)

* **CPU:** AMD *Ryzen 7 7700X* — 8c/16t, strong single-thread. — **$320**
* **Motherboard:** *B650* ATX (e.g., MSI B650 Tomahawk or ASUS TUF B650-PLUS) — AM5, DDR5 support — **$160**
* **GPU:** *AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT (20GB)* — 20 GB VRAM (sufficient for 4-bit 20B). Prefer new from ASUS/Sapphire/MSI — **$850–$950**
* **RAM:** *64 GB (2×32 GB) DDR5-5600/6000* — DDR5-5600/6000 CL32 — **$180–$260**
  *Note:* For strict budget you can choose **32 GB (2×16)** now and upgrade later; but 64 GB is safer.
* **Primary NVMe:** *1 TB PCIe4 NVMe* (Samsung 990 Pro or WD SN850) — **$110–$140**
* **PSU:** *850 W 80+ Gold* (Corsair RM850x / Seasonic Focus GX) — **$100–$150**
* **CPU Cooler:** 240 mm AIO (NZXT Kraken X53 / Corsair H100) or quality air cooler — **$80–$120**
* **Case:** Good airflow mid-tower (Fractal Meshify, Phanteks P400A) — **$70–$120**
* **Misc (fans, cables, thermal paste):** **$30–$60**

**Estimated subtotal:** $1,900 (with 32GB RAM) → $2,050 (with 64GB RAM).
**Savings vs recommended (~$2,840 parts-only):** ~**$790–$940** (meets your $800–$1,200 target).

### Why this works

* **RX 7900 XT (20GB)** has enough VRAM to hold a 20B model quantized to 4-bit (≈10–12 GB) with room for GPU buffers.
* **Ryzen 7 7700X** (8c/16t) is still very capable for token preprocessing and feeding GPU.
* **64 GB RAM** ideal; 32 GB will still run 4-bit 20B but leaves less headroom for other apps — recommended to aim for 64 if budget allows.
* **PCIe4 NVMe** ensures quick model load times without needing PCIe5.

### Expected performance (very approximate)

* **GPT-OSS 20B (4-bit)** on RX 7900 XT → **~3–6 tokens/sec** (depends on runtime, quantization, threading).
* **Smaller models (7B/13B)** will be much faster (10–30 t/s).

# Budget Option B — Tighter Value Build (max savings, used GPU)

**Target:** aggressive cost reduction while still enabling 4-bit 20B. Use a *used* GPU (good deal hunting required).

**Estimated total:** **≈ $1,400 – $1,600**

### Parts (exact/typical SKUs)

* **CPU:** *Ryzen 5 7600X* (6c/12t) — **$230**
* **Motherboard:** *B650* or B650M — **$120–$150**
* **GPU (used):** *AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT (16GB) used* — **$450–$650** (used market)
  *Alternative used: RX 7900 XT if you can find one for ~$700–$850 — better choice if available*
* **RAM:** *32 GB (2×16) DDR5-5600/6000* — **$120–$160**
* **Primary NVMe:** *1 TB PCIe4 NVMe* — **$100–$120**
* **PSU:** *850 W 80+ Gold* — **$100**
* **CPU Cooler:** solid air cooler (Noctua NH-U12S) or 240 AIO — **$60–$100**
* **Case + misc:** **$80–$100**

**Estimated subtotal:** **$1,400–$1,600**
**Savings vs recommended (~$2,840):** **~$1,200–$1,440**

### Tradeoffs and notes

* **RX 6900 XT (16 GB)**: 16 GB VRAM is **enough for 4-bit 20B (~10–12GB)**, but leaves less VRAM room for multi-buffers or memory fragmentation. You must ensure model + runtime buffers fit. Some runtimes may need extra tuning.
* **Ryzen 5 7600X** has fewer cores — will slightly limit preprocessing throughput; CPU may become a mild bottleneck if heavy multitasking.
* **Used GPU risks**: warranty, unknown usage, driver quirks. Buy from reputable sellers with returns.

### Expected performance (approx)

* **With RX 6900 XT (16GB)**: **~2–4 tokens/sec** for 20B (4-bit), depending on runtime and optimizations. Possibly slower than RX 7900 XT.
* **If you find a used RX 7900 XT (~$700–$850)**, expect similar performance to Balanced Budget (~3–6 t/s).

---

# What to upgrade later (if you start with tighter build)

1. **RAM:** upgrade from 32 → 64 GB when budget allows (biggest single uplift for stability).
2. **GPU:** replace used 6900 XT with RX 7900 XT/XTX for faster tokens/sec and more VRAM headroom.
3. **NVMe capacity:** add a second NVMe for datasets/models to avoid juggling files.

---

# Software & runtime tips for both builds

* Use **llama.cpp** with Vulkan backend or a runtime that supports AMD GPU acceleration (Vulkan / ROCm where available).
* Prefer **4-bit GGUF/GPTQ** quantized models for lowest memory footprint.
* Tune threads (CPU) and `n_batch`/`n_ctx` to balance latency vs throughput.
* Monitor VRAM usage; if model doesn’t fit, try a 4-bit variant with GPTQ/GGUF.

---

# Shopping tips & cautions

* **GPU prices fluctuate** — check Newegg, Amazon, local sellers, and reputable used marketplaces (e.g., eBay with buyer protection).
* If buying used, prefer sellers with return windows and verify photos/serial if possible.
* **RAM timing**: buy a tested DDR5 kit (same dual-rank sticks), avoid mixing kits.
* **PSU quality** matters — don’t buy the cheapest. Good PSU protects your expensive GPU/CPU.

* If your goal is **maximum savings now** and you’re comfortable risk-managing used parts and future upgrades, use **Option B** and plan to upgrade RAM/GPU later.


# Why **Ryzen 9 7950X + RX 7900 XTX + 64 GB** (updated: memory, PCIe, SSD)

### Quick summary of the new details

* **RAM type:** DDR5 is recommended for Ryzen 9 7950X (speed and Infinity Fabric behavior).
* **RAM speed:** Aim for **DDR5-6000 MT/s** (or 5600–6400 MT/s) CL30–36 for best latency/throughput balance on Zen4.
* **PCIe:** **PCIe 4.0 x16** is sufficient for a GPU like RX 7900 XTX; **PCIe 5.0** is beneficial for NVMe SSDs and future GPUs but not required for GPU performance today.
* **NVMe SSD:** Use **PCIe 4.0 NVMe** with sustained sequential reads ~5–7 GB/s (5000–7000 MB/s). If you want the fastest possible model load times and you have a PCIe5 motherboard, **PCIe 5.0 NVMe** drives (read ~10–12+ GB/s) are an extra boost for model I/O.

# Why these choices matter (technical view)

## DDR5 vs DDR4 (and speed)

* **Ryzen 9 7950X (Zen4)**:

  * Designed for **DDR5**. DDR5 gives higher bandwidth which helps when the CPU is moving large model chunks and when the system uses RAM as staging for GPU transfers.
  * **Recommended speed:** DDR5-6000 MT/s is a well-known sweet spot for Ryzen 7000-series — it often allows Infinity Fabric to run 1:1 (better latency) and yields the best practical throughput. DDR5-5600 → good, DDR5-6400 → sometimes faster but may need manual tuning/timings.
  * **Timings:** lower CAS latency helps, but MT/s matters more for AI workloads (bandwidth-bound). Typical good kit: **6000 MT/s CL30–36**.
* **If you choose Ryzen 5000 (5900X)**:

  * **DDR4-3600 CL16** is ideal. DDR5 is not supported by that platform.
* **Why not DDR4 on 7950X?**

  * 7950X motherboards support DDR5 only; DDR4 is incompatible. For other CPUs, DDR4 is fine but lower bandwidth.

## Capacity (64 GB vs 32 GB)

* **64 GB** gives headroom for:

  * FP16/8-bit weights and runtime buffers
  * caching multiple models, datasets, or running containers/IDE alongside inference
  * avoiding swap (swap kills throughput)
* **32 GB** may be okay for 4-bit 20B but is tight and risky.

## PCIe 4.0 vs PCIe 5.0

* **GPU:** RX 7900 XTX runs perfectly on **PCIe 4.0 x16**. Moving to PCIe 5.0 gives little-to-no real-world inference speedup today because the GPU computation is the bottleneck, not PCIe link bandwidth for steady-state inference.
* **NVMe SSDs:** Where PCIe5 shines — **PCIe 5.0 NVMe** offers ~10–14 GB/s sequential reads and speeds up model load times and swap-backed workloads significantly. If you often load many model checkpoints or large datasets, PCIe5 NVMe helps.
* **Practical:** Buy a good PCIe4 NVMe unless you specifically want the fastest possible model load times and have a PCIe5 board.

## NVMe SSD Read/Write (what to pick)

* **Good target for model work:**

  * **PCIe4 NVMe:** Sequential read **5,000–7,000 MB/s**; write similar for high-end drives. Examples: Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black SN850 – fast and reliable.
  * **PCIe5 NVMe:** Sequential read **10,000–14,000 MB/s**; cutting-edge (requires PCIe5 motherboard).
* **Why sequential read matters:** Model files are large sequential reads when loading weights; higher read speeds reduce model startup time and any disk-backed paging overhead.
* **IOPS & endurance:** For cache-heavy usage, consider high IOPS and higher TBW (endurance) ratings if you will swap or write a lot.

# Concrete component recommendations

* **RAM (Ryzen 7950X combo)**:

  * Buy **2×32 GB DDR5-6000 CL30** (dual-channel) or **4×16 GB** if motherboard supports quad. Good kits: reputable brands (G.Skill Trident Z5, Corsair Dominator DDR5).
  * On Ryzen 7000, DDR5-6000 often hits a good Infinity Fabric 1:1 ratio.
* **SSD**:

  * **Primary NVMe (OS + models):** 1–2 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe (Samsung 990 Pro, WD SN850) — read ~7000 MB/s.
  * **Optional ultra-fast scratch:** If you have PCIe5 board, consider a PCIe5 drive for super-fast model loads.
* **Motherboard**:

  * X670E/B650E for Ryzen 7000 – choose one with multiple M.2 NVMe slots and PCIe 4.0/5.0 support if future-proofing.
* **PSU & Cooling**:

  * PSU: 850–1000 W high-quality Gold/Plat
  * Cooling: 240–360 mm AIO for 7950X sustained loads

# Practical tuning tips

* **Memory config:** Use dual-channel kits (2 sticks) for simplicity; 64 GB as 2×32 GB is ideal. Populate recommended slots per manual.
* **RAM speed tuning:** Set XMP/EXPO to kit speed (6000) and verify FCLK (Infinity Fabric) settings — many motherboards support 1:1 at 6000.
* **SSD configuration:** Put models on the fastest NVMe drive. If using swap, use a fast NVMe with high TBW.
* **PCIe lanes:** Make sure the GPU gets full x16 lanes (most desktop boards give this to GPU slot).
