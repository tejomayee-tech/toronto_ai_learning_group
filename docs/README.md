Welcome to the official repository for the Toronto AI Learning Group - a collaborative space where community-led sessions, resources, and discussions are organized and shared.

### 🎯 In one line from **ChatGPT**

  The culture of open sharing, learning, and collaboration is the **engine of progress in AI**. Proprietary tools are the **vehicles** that make that progress practical, accessible, and sustainable. But without the engine, the vehicle goes nowhere.
  **promotions, tool referrals, or marketing content** mainly drive usage and sales. They don’t advance the science itself—they ride on the wave of what community-driven research has already created.
