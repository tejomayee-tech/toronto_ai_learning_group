### **Objective**

To provide a clear roadmap for beginners to start their AI journey—whether through **no-code exploration** or **coding-based learning**—by focusing on practical skills, daily automation, and progressive workflow building.

---

### **Goal**

* Enable beginners to **leverage AI effectively** in daily life and work.
* Build confidence in **prompting, automation, and workflow design** before diving into programming.
* Offer an alternative technical path (Python + data science libraries) for those aiming at developer or advanced technical roles.
* Encourage **project-based learning** and portfolio creation to demonstrate practical expertise.

* **Start with No-Code Tools & Accessibility**

  * Modern AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are built for non-technical users—no coding required.
  * Begin as an *“Everyday Explorer”*: simplify life, summarize documents, and organize tasks with AI.
  * Even if aiming for technical roles, start with Generative AI (GenAI) first.

* **Prompting is the Core Skill**

  * The most essential ability: *communicating effectively with AI*.
  * Use the simple structure:

    * **Aim** → What you want AI to do
    * **Context** → Background/relevant information
    * **Rules** → Constraints, format, or style requirements

* **Practice Through Daily Automation**

  * Identify pain points in work/life and apply AI to solve them.
  * Start by automating personal tasks to boost efficiency.
  * Use existing tools (*AI Consumers / Level 3*), e.g., custom GPTs or content generators.

* **Advance to Workflow Building (No-Code Platforms)**

  * Learn “Workflow Thinking”: break large tasks into smaller steps.
  * Automate and connect steps (*“Creative Remixing”*) with no-code platforms:

    * **Zapier**, **Make**, **N8N**, etc.
  * Transition into a *Builder (Level 2)* → creating custom tools or agents that can reason and make decisions.

* **Programming Alternative (If Coding Route Chosen)**

  * Set up a stable dev environment (e.g., **VS Code**).
  * Learn Python fundamentals, then progress to libraries:

    * **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**.
  * Focus on project-based learning → build portfolio projects early.
